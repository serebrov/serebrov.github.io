So you can avoid cluttering npm registry with similar packages, creating confusing for other people.
NPM supports installing dependencies from github, but it is also good to have versioning for your package so you can use it exactly as other packages, develop it independently and upgrade the dependency for the main project in a controlled way.</description></item></channel></rss>
