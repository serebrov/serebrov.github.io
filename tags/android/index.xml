After update to BusyBox 1.20.1 my moblie GPRS network became broken. I got network indicator (E with two arrows), but can not access network.
I suspected that this was someting with dns settings, but did not find any solution. I uninstalled busybox, but this didn&amp;rsquo;t help. I did a factory reset - also didn&amp;rsquo;t help. Actually I thought factory reset wil return my device to the original state, but then noticed that I still have root and busybox.</description></item></channel></rss>
