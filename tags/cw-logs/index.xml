The Logs UI is really complex to use - I need to remember instance names, open the log group I need and then go into each instance logs one-by-one to check them.
A more convenient alternative is to use one stream like error_log for all instances.
Update: logging to the same stream from multiple sources is not recommended and may cause duplicate records (although in my case this is fine).</description></item><item><title>Elastic Beanstalk - how to setup CloudWatch Logs</title><link>https://serebrov.github.io/html/2015-05-20-cloudwatch-setup.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://serebrov.github.io/html/2015-05-20-cloudwatch-setup.html</guid><description>CloudWatch Logs is an AWS service to collect and monitor system and application logs. On the top level setup is this:
install CloudWatch agent to collect logs data and send to CloudWatch Logs service define log metric filters to extract useful data, like number of all errors or information about some specific events create alarms for metrics to get notifications about logs make sure that the instance role has permissions to push logs to CloudWatch (see comments for details about this issue) All the configuration can be done using the Elastic Beanstalk config.</description></item></channel></rss>
