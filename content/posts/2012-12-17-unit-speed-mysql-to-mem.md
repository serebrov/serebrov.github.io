There are several ways to speedup slow unit tests which interact with database:
 * Refactor code and tests and do not interact with db in unit tests
 * Use sqlite db in memory instead of MySql
 * Use MySql MEMORY engine
 * Move MySql data to memory

<!-- more -->
It is better to try other listed approaches and I think of last method as of quick temporary hack, but here it is:
 * stop mysql
 * move /var/lib/mysql to /dev/shm/mysql
 * link /var/lib/mysql to /dev/shm/mysql
 * start mysql

In Ubuntu there is also a problem with apparmor which will not allow mysql to read from /dev/shm.
To fix this it is recommended to add following to the `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld`:

```bash
    /dev/shm/mysql/ r,
    /dev/shm/mysql/** rwk,
```

But it doesn't work for me and I disabled apparmor for mysql (not recommended):

    sudo mv /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld /etc/apparmor.d/disable

Below are shell scripts to move MySql data to /dev/shm and back, restore backed up data and check db state.

Move db to memory script
--------------------------------------------

```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    #Check if run as root
    if [ `whoami` != root ]
    then
        echo "You must be root to do that!"
        exit 1
    fi

    service mysql stop
    if [ ! -s /var/lib/mysql.backup ]
    then
        cp -pRL /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysql.backup
    fi
    mv /var/lib/mysql /dev/shm/mysql
    chown -R mysql:mysql /dev/shm/mysql
    ln -s /dev/shm/mysql /var/lib/mysql
    chown -h mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
    service mysql start
```

Move db to disk script
--------------------------------------------

```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    #Check if run as root
    if [ `whoami` != root ]
    then
        echo "You must be root to do that!"
        exit 1
    fi

    service mysql stop
    rm /var/lib/mysql
    if [ ! -s /dev/shm/mysql ]
    then
        cp -pRL /var/lib/mysql.backup /var/lib/mysql
    else
        mv /dev/shm/mysql /var/lib/mysql
    fi
    service mysql start
```


Restore db backup script
--------------------------------------------

```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    #Check if run as root
    if [ `whoami` != root ]
    then
        echo "You must be root to do that!"
        exit 1
    fi

    service mysql stop
    if [ ! -s /var/lib/mysql.backup ]
    then
        exit -1
    fi
    rm /var/lib/mysql
    cp -pRL /var/lib/mysql.backup /var/lib/mysql
    rm -rf /dev/shm/mysql
    service mysql start
```

Check db state script
--------------------------------------------

```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    #Check if run as root
    if [ `whoami` != root ]
    then
        echo "You must be root to do that!"
        exit 1
    fi

    if [ -L /var/lib/mysql ]
    then
        echo "Mem db"
        exit 0
    else
        echo "File db"
        exit 1
    fi
```
