With angular.js you have an HTML which looks like this:

```html
    <span>{{variableValue}}</span>
    <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="item in items" ng-bind="item.name"></li>
    </ul>
```

The simple way to make this content SEO-friendly is to pre-render data on the server and then allow angular to do it's job on the client.
<!-- more -->
For simple variables there is [ng-bind](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngBind).
And for lists there is [ng-include](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngInclude).
Here is the example from above with pre-rendered content:

```html
    <span ng-bind="variableValue">Static indexed value</span>
    <ul ng-include="'your/dynamic/list'">
        <li>seo-friendly item1</li>
        <li>seo-friendly item2</li>
    </ul>
    <script type="text/ng-template" id="your/dynamic/list">
        <li ng-repeat="item in items" ng-bind="item.name"></li>
    </script>
```

This way we have initial content for search bots and instructions for angular at the same time.

Note that the solution above works for simple cases but it can be not good for
complex pages or if there are many pages.  Actually what we do is duplicate the
content - we provide static content on the server site and then angular
requests content dynamically an overrides static data.

A better (and more complex) solution is to crawl the website and give static page
snapshots to search engines.  This can be done with a headless browser like
[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) which you can run periodically to generate
static page snapshots.

There is also an easy way to do this - use a service like
[BromBone](http://www.brombone.com/).  It will do complex part of the job for
you and you only need to redirect search bots to static versions of your pages
generated by BromBone.
