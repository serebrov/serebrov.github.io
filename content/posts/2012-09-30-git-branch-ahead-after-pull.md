Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit (or X commits) after `git pull origin master`.

The sequence:
* Have up-to-date repository
* There is a change in the origin/master
* Do `git pull origin master`
* Change is received and merged
* git status shows “Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.”

The reason is because during “pull origin master” reference to the remote
origin/master is not changed (still points to older version).

<!-- more -->
To check this:

    git diff origin/master

It will show the difference - it should be the last master change.

To fix this exacute:

    git fetch origin

This will update git links to remotes.

If you have this situation then you probably wanted to do just `git pull` instead of `git pull origin master`.
